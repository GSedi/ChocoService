Online recording system for the provision of services
The service will be used as an independent unit, will receive / send data on the API and store information about the records. Third-party services will access it via API.
Approximate case: Access to the Salon. The salon gives access to masters, at the same time it fills in the information about each master: work experience, list of services provided. Wizards clog / synchronize the recording time with the “Record to Master” system. The user selects the salon, the wizard and the service through some interface and reserves the place. Comes, gets his favor. Master in the system indicates that the service is provided. The system status is changing.
